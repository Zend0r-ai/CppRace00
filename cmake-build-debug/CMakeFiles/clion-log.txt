CMake Warning at 3dparty/CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  By not providing "FindSFML.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "SFML", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "SFML" (requested
  version 2.5.1) with any of the following names:

    SFMLConfig.cmake
    sfml-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "SFML" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "SFML_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "SFML"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.

CMake Warning (dev) at /Users/vkniaziev/Desktop/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/share/cmake-3.17/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:272 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (VORBIS)
  does not match the name of the calling package (Vorbis).  This can lead to
  problems in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables
  (e.g., `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  3dparty/sfml/cmake/Modules/FindVorbis.cmake:25 (find_package_handle_standard_args)
  3dparty/sfml/cmake/Macros.cmake:279 (find_package)
  3dparty/sfml/src/SFML/Audio/CMakeLists.txt:70 (sfml_find_package)
